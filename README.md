## Hardware Dependencies
This project is very hardware oriented, and once we describe each item it will show how intuitive the hole system is.

1. We use a D/D Blower w/ Motor, 208-230/460 V. For our desired system we need a reliable and robust blower/motor
combination. This blower has an 11-inch turbine which is large enough to not get jammed or
clogged by small paper shreds. The motor that comes with this setup is a 1 horsepower 3
phase electric motor that can spin upwards of 3500 RPM. With our system, we plan on using
4 inches ducting for the inlet and the exhaust side and with a 4-inch outlet, this blower can
push nearly 560 CFM which should be plenty for our application

## Software Dependencies
For the moment we are not using any software dependencies, later on we might include a sensor to detect when to run the whole system, but for now no software has been used.
