## Hardware Dependencies
This project is very hardware oriented, and once we describe each item it will show how intuitive the hole system is.

1. We use a D/D Blower w/ Motor, 208-230/460 V. For our desired system we need a reliable and robust blower/motor
combination. This blower has an 11-inch turbine which is large enough to not get jammed or
clogged by small paper shreds. The motor that comes with this setup is a 1 horsepower 3
phase electric motor that can spin upwards of 3500 RPM. With our system, we plan on using
4 inches ducting for the inlet and the exhaust side and with a 4-inch outlet, this blower can
push nearly 560 CFM which should be plenty for our application

2. We use a 3 Phase 30A 3.7KW Maintained Self Lock On/Off Power Pushbutton Switch. It has ideal specifications to deal with the power needed by the motor and has the perfect 
functionality we are looking for our system. Once pressed On it maintains like that until we press the Off button.

3.We use a MODEL GN3442 GAYLORD COVER because the goal of the system designed in this project is to get the shredded paper
automatically into the big brown box provided by the mailing service company. In order to do
that, we require this component because the whole system works around a motor/blower
that creates wind gusts that would make kind of sloppy the whole movement of the paper.
This device provides a specific and convenient solution, covering the box and just letting the
tube with the shredded paper have access to it. This way, we use the cover until the box is
full and then easily remove it to get the shredded paper out.

## Software Dependencies
For the moment we are not using any software dependencies, later on we might include a sensor to detect when to run the whole system, but for now no software has been used.
